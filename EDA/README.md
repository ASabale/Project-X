# Bank Account Fraud (BAF) Detection - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview

This project explores the BAF Dataset Suite for the purpose of building a real-time machine learning model to detect fraudulent bank account applications. The dataset is designed to benchmark ML performance and fairness in dynamic, realistic conditions.

---

## Dataset Description

- **Source:** Synthetic, feature-engineered bank account applications generated by CTGAN (Feedzai).
- **Target Variable:** `fraud_bool`
    - `1` = Fraudulent application
    - `0` = Legitimate application
- **Temporal Nature:** The `month` column enables time-based validation.
- **Class Imbalance:**
    - Fraudulent (1): **1.1%**
    - Legitimate (0): **98.9%**

### Main Features
- Numeric: `income`, `credit_risk_score`, `customer_age`, etc.
- Categorical: `payment_type`, `employment_status`, `housing_status`, `device_os`, `source`
- Binary: `email_is_free`, `phone_home_valid`, `foreign_request`, etc.
- Temporal: `month`, `days_since_request`
- Engineered: Application and device activity patterns, address history, proposed credit, etc.

## Initial Data Analysis

### 1. **Missing Data**
- Checked for missing values. Features like address months or amounts use special codes (e.g., `-1`) to indicate missingness.

### 2. **Class Distribution**
- **Counts:**  
  fraud_bool: 0 - 988,971 and 1 - 11,029
- **Percentages:**  
  fraud_bool: 0 - 98.9% and 1 - 1.1%


### 3. **Feature Importance**
- Initial tests (e.g., with tree-based models) show features like `credit_risk_score`, `income`, and application velocity (`velocity_6h`, `velocity_24h`) as highly predictive.

### 4. **Temporal Analysis**
- Data is inherently temporal. The `month` column enables time-based training/validation (e.g., validate/train on months 0–5, test on 6–7).

### 5. **Feature Transformation**
- Applied **Yeo-Johnson transformation** on numeric features; it performed better than log or Box-Cox transformations for this dataset.

### 6. **Categorical Encoding**
- **One-hot encoding** was selected for categorical variables based on exploratory analysis.

## Key Findings

- **Severe class imbalance** requires careful handling (specialized metrics, resampling, or threshold tuning).
- **Temporal structure** supports realistic evaluation and can capture drift.
- **Synthetic but realistic** dataset; labels are trustworthy as per documentation.
- **No confidential or personal identifiers**—data is anonymized and privacy-preserving.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize preprocessing:** Transform and encode features as identified.
2. **Model development:** Build and evaluate ML models with temporal validation.
3. **Streaming pipeline:** Integrate with real-time systems (e.g., Spark, Kafka, Iceberg).
4. **Monitor fairness and drift:** Assess and track model fairness and performance over time.
